    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ashure, Aşure, Anoushabour, Noah's pudding or Trigo koço is a sweet pudding eaten in parts of Western Asia and
        the Balkans that is made of a mixture consisting of various types of grains, fresh and dried fruits, and nuts.
    </p>
    <p>Ashure was traditionally made and eaten during the colder months of the year due to its heavy and calorie rich
        nature, but now it is enjoyed year-round. The dish is traditionally made in large quantities and is distributed
        to friends, relatives, neighbors, colleagues, classmates, and others, without regard to the recipient's religion
        or belief system as an offering of peace and love.
