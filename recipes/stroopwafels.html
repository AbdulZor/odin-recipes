    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dutch stroopwafels are thin waffle cookies filled with caramel. They're popular with people of all nationalities,
        so I translated this Dutch recipe into English.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ⅛ cups butter, melted</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup warm milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) envelopes active dry yeast</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start the cookies: Mix flour, melted butter, sugar, warm milk, egg, and yeast together in a large bowl. When
            dough becomes too stiff to stir, turn out onto a floured surface and knead by hand for a few minutes. Set
            aside to rise for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the filling: Heat molasses, brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon in a saucepan over medium heat until
            warm. Stir to blend and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat a pizzelle iron according to manufacturer's instructions and spray with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Finish the cookies: Knead dough briefly, then divide into twelve pieces. Roll each piece into a 2-inch ball.
            Press one ball at a time in the center of the preheated pizzelle iron. Close the iron and cook until golden
            brown, 1 1/2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the iron and carefully cut warm cookie in half horizontally with a
            serrated knife. Spread filling on the inside and sandwich the two halves back together. Repeat to cook and
            fill remaining cookies.</li>
    </ol>
